What is eserial?
----------------

eserial is the (RS232) serial interface code from eppp_
(circa 1996..1998), which will be brought up to today's
(circa 2009) standards.

How do I compile, install, and use it?
--------------------------------------

For compile+install, see the INSTALL file.

For how to use eserial... see the source code, which is
almost certainly going to change.


Project Status
--------------

Not usable. Needs adaptation to modern systems, bugfixes,
code audit, API cleanup/redesign, and probably more.
