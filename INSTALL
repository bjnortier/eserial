How to build and install eppp
=============================

As a general rule, you can use the common

   $ ./configure
   $ make
   # make install

sequence.

If you have modified configure.ac or Makefile.am or do not have the
configure and Makefile.in files, you probably should run this first:

   $ autoreconf -vis .

If you want to give some compiler parameters to erlc, you can just call
make with ERLCFLAGS set, e.g.

   $ make ERLCFLAGS="-DCURRENT_DIR_HACK=true"
          # to let eppp_serial.beam look for eppp_serial in the current directory

TODO: Currently, only eppp_serial works. The eppp code needs some work.

For backwards compatibility, src/Makefile{,.serial} are still shipped, but
are completely unrelated to configure or Makefile.am.
